"While building BullBear-Hub, we gained skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated real-time APIs,
and implemented dynamic data visualizations with libraries like Plotly.
We learned user-centered design, dataset handling, and financial trend analysis. 
Additionally, we improved project management, debugging, and problem-solving skills to create a responsive,
engaging platform for cryptocurrency and stock market insights."
